# Project overview
The discontinuity in benefit duration at age 40 creates a sudden, policy-induced change in how
long individuals can receive unemployment benefits. Specifically, individuals who are just over
age 40 receive longer benefit durations than those just under 40.
Since individuals just above and below age 40 are similar in all other respects, we can treat
the cutoff as generating quasi-random variation in benefit duration.
This allows us to compare outcomes — like log wages in the new job — for individuals just
below and just above the cutoff. If we observe a jump in wages at the cutoff, we can attribute it
to the effect of longer benefit duration, since that’s the only factor that changes discontinuously
at age 40.
In other words, the causal effect of benefit duration on post-unemployment wages can be
estimated by exploiting the sharp jump in benefit eligibility at the age-40 threshold. This
design isolates the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) for individuals near the cutoff.
